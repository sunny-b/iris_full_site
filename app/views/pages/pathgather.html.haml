      %p.reading.mid Pathgather is a learning platform for enterprise companies. I am leading the redesign of Pathgatherâ€™s entire platform, end-to-end, acting as a product manager, UX designer, UX researcher, UI designer, brand designer and design manager.
      %p.reading.mid.gimme-less-space I was the first product person hired at Pathgather. I led an UX audit and conducted internal and external user interviews. I discovered high leverage usability issues. I suggested doing a redesign of the entire platform. The design method we employed was Dual Track Agile. After user interviews, I documented all the insights and then created user stories to support each feature. I led the complete redesign of the end-user app. We created an MVP for our end user experience then took the MVP to our customers.

      %p.reading.mid I led all the UX validation interviews for our MVP while building the Admin interface. Documented all the insights into Product Board, a product management tool. I used product board to quantify all the qualitative insights. Mapping individual insights to drivers such as usability and engagement, and features.
      %p.readming.mid.gimme-less-space From this process I created 130 new features and had a data driven prioritized design backlog. Created an executive summary based off of the insights. I managed a design contractor who built the full fledged mobile experience. Worked cross functionally with the Marketing department to mange a marketing designer.
      %p.reading.mid.gimme-less-space I also rebranded the company with a new logo and brand colors for the app.
