I led an UX audit and conducted internal and external user interviews. I discovered high leverage usability issues. I suggested doing a redesign of the entire platform. The design method we employed was Dual Track Agile. After user interviews, I documented all the insights and then created user stories to support each feature. I led the complete redesign of the end-user app. We created an MVP for our end user experience then took the MVP to our customers.'],
